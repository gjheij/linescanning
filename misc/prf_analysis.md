# pRF analysis template file
The accompanying `yml`-file acts as template for population receptive field (pRF) analyses. One important note on the `distance_screen_cm` variable: initially this was `225`cm, but was changed to `196` mid-experimentation. Some acquisitions need to be analysed with the 225cm distance, while other, more recently acquired data needs to be analyzed with the 196cm. 

Specifically, the line-scanning acquisitions will all have to be analyzed with the new setting (196), while all whole-brain data (until `sub-011`) should be analyzed using the old setting (225)!
