Welcome to the linescanning repository
===========================================

.. image:: ../imgs/overview.png

This repository contains all of the tools used during the acquisition and postprocessing of line scanning data at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging in Amsterdam. 
The script master controls the modules prefixed by spinoza_, which in turn call upon various scripts in the utils and bin directory. The scripts in the latter 
folders are mostly helper scripts to make life a tad easier. The repository contains a mix of languages in bash, python, and matlab.
